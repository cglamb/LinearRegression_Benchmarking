## Introduction
This project tests linear regression performed in Python, R, and Go for consistency and performance. We found all three programming languages produced consistent results. R had the shortest run-time, while Golang had the longest runtime. Results and a management recommendation are presented in the sections immediately below. The balance of this README discusses experiment design and the files contained in this GitHub.

## Results - Consistency
Consistency was measured by ensuring each programming language produced the same linear fit on each of four data sets. We present the intercept and slope for each dataset and programming language below. The linear fit was found to be identical across all three languages.

|                | Data Set 1        | Data Set 2        | Data Set 3        | Data Set 4        |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Python**     | 3.0001, 0.5001     | 3.0009, 0.5000     | 3.0025, 0.4997     | 3.0017, 0.4999     |
| **R**          | 3.0001, 0.5001     | 3.001, 0.500       | 3.0025, 0.4997     | 3.0017, 0.4999     |
| **Go**         | 3.0001, 0.5001     | 3.0009, 0.5000     | 3.0025, 0.4997     | 3.0017, 0.4999     |

## Results - Benchmarking
To measure the speed at which the file executed, each file was run 10 times. The console was cleared between each execution to ensure no warmstarting. Results per trial are shown below. Times are shown in seconds.

| Trial | .py  | .r   | .go  |

| 3     | 0.031| 0.024| 0.100|
| 4     | 0.031| 0.017| 0.113|
| 5     | 0.031| 0.019| 0.134|
| 6     | 0.031| 0.042| 0.112|
| 7     | 0.031| 0.018| 0.124|

| 10    | 0.032| 0.016| 0.120|
| Avg   | 0.033| 0.021| 0.117|

*Note: Go benchmarking using b.N iterations produces a 0.128s runtime, as opposed to the 0.117s above.*

## Management Recommendation
We recognize the benefit of the Company having a singular coding language. Usage of a singular language cross-company should allow for greater collaboration between technical departments. However, we do find some disadvantages from a data science team being moved to GoLang. The first disadvantage is longer runtimes. In our limited study, we found a simple regression took significantly longer to run in Golang than both Python and R (factor of 3-6 times slower). A second disadvantage is modeling packages in Golang appear less robust based on our limited study. For example, to generate statistics as simple as the intercept and slope of a linear regression required building custom functions. Finally, while Golang is growing in popularity, it is still less well-known amongst the data science community than R or Python. This may make talent acquisition difficult and costly. We recommend further testing around runtimes and robustness of modeling packages in Golang. These challenges can be overcome, but the Company should understand the investment it might require to overcome these hurdles. Most importantly, we recommend HR conduct market research around the relative availability of data science professionals with prior experience working in Golang. If usage of Golang would make talent acquisition difficult, we would recommend remaining with Python and Go.

### Datasets
Linear regressions were modeled on four different datasets from Anscombe (1973). For convenience, the four datasets are provided below:

```python
{'x1': [10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5],
 'x2': [10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5],
 'x3': [10, 8, 13, 9, 11, 14, 6, 4, 12, 7, 5],
 'x4': [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 19, 8, 8, 8],
 'y1': [8.04, 6.95, 7.58, 8.81, 8.33, 9.96, 7.24, 4.26, 10.84, 4.82, 5.68],
 'y2': [9.14, 8.14, 8.74, 8.77, 9.26, 8.1, 6.13, 3.1, 9.13, 7.26, 4.74],
 'y3': [7.46, 6.77, 12.74, 7.11, 7.81, 8.84, 6.08, 5.39, 8.15, 6.42, 5.73],
 'y4': [6.58, 5.76, 7.71, 8.84, 8.47, 7.04, 5.25, 12.5, 5.56, 7.91, 6.89]}
